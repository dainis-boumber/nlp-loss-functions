# nlp-loss-functions
Here I collect various loss functions, metrics, coefficients, and other things of similar nature that are not common and useful for NLP tasks I work on. Much of this repo is dedicated to calibration and balancing.

Credit for the focal loss goes to [Adrien Lucas Ecoffet](https://becominghuman.ai/@AdrienLE). The multilabel version is numerically unstable, I will update in the readme once I figure out a way to fix it. Until then use with caution or better yet,  find another implementation just ot be sure.

Thanks to Umberto Griffo for implementing and making available Focal Loss in Keras. Original work by Umberto is here: https://github.com/umbertogriffo
